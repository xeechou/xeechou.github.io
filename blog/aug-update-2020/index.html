      <section class="post-content"><p>It is a sunny day, somehow I got up early this morning. The cool, chilling
breath of air reminded me we are at the tail of the summer. It felt so strange,
this summer was like it was never here. Hiking, go swimming, taking a trips and
night outs. all those experiences for a normal summer I would do, they are all
absent, hope I don&rsquo;t regret too much for crunching code at home all these
months. It was a tough year actually, I was determined to push Taiwins to a
usable state, it has been stressful. Every time I look at the pile of the TODO
list, a sentiment of endless development and desperate hit me hard like a heart
attack. I had to work <strong>a lot</strong> to stay healthy.</p>
<p>Here I am taking a clear picture of my memory from April. In the begining it was
only getting a window to show up, and getting <code>wl_seat</code> to work, then I needed
to draw surfaces, that is implementing <code>wl_surface</code>, binding textures from
<code>wl_buffers</code> and paint them on the window, I had to writing dummy clients which
normally shouldn&rsquo;t work because <code>wl_surface</code> requires a &ldquo;role&rdquo; (like
<code>xdg_toplevel</code>). Rigging up the surface transformation code so it rotates and
scale correctly. Boy, those transformations, I realised my understanding of
Inverse Matrix was not correct at all. Subsurfaces was developped along the way,
I didn&rsquo;t even know the usage at the begining, until I read this
<a href="https://ppaalanen.blogspot.com/2013/11/sub-surfaces-now.html">blog-post</a>. Back
then when I was writing wayland client library, I needed not care about the
protocol I don&rsquo;t understand, but now I have no choice now I guess. Then here we
go, the <code>xdg_surface</code>. The one that gives you all the desktop applications,
turns you surfaces into <code>xdg_toplevel</code> and <code>xdg_popup</code>. The difficulty was that
I want to implement the
<a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/weston/blob/master/include/libweston-desktop/libweston-desktop.h">libweston-desktop</a>
style interface so I can interface with <code>wl_shell_surface</code> as
well. <code>xdg_surface</code> was way more complicated, this is the point where I ran into
the wall of <em>wl_object dependency</em>, where I found clients offer destruct
<code>wl_surface</code>, <code>xdg_surface</code>, <code>xdg_toplevel</code>, <code>xdg_popup</code> in the arbitrary
orders. Boy I hope I implement the dependency correctly, now I do not run into
dangling pointers (or I think)? Plenty of protocols like <code>wp-viewporter</code> and
<code>wp-presentation</code> were implemented along the way, those were &ldquo;easier&rdquo; one, did
not give me many hiccups. Now I am on the way implementing an efficient
renderer. Interestingly even with only a basic renderer, the renderer is still
performing at sub-millisecond per frame.</p>
<p>Now compared to June or May, I felt much better, back then it felt like mission
impossible, I tried to focus on the moment, try not think about how it can
accomplish like KWin. But who I am kidding, With myself, certainly NO, only if I
can get more people engaged in the project, the one thing I am not good at.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">July, the hottest month in Montreal every year. The heat wave rushes to you when you walk outside makes you wondering if you are in some tropical island, it sure doesn&rsquo;t look like living at 45 latitde northen hemisphere. Last month was a rapid leap towards wayland objects implementations and now I just hitted the wall of xdg-shell protocol. Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about what it is like to implement a wayland protocol.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">As the taiwins project finished with X11/Wayland backend rigging. Now I am fully on the libdrm backend development, dealing with hardwares directly. This backend requires 200 percent my energy to tame the complexity.
Like other backends, libdrm also needs to provide two resources, input and output. Backends like nested wayland backend or X11 backend, the output device are the windows created by ourselves (or by the user). Meaning we can create it or destroy it as we please.</p>
