      <section class="post-content"><p>I am now back in Canada, quarantined again. There is much of internal struggle
whether I should move back or stay in Shanghai? Working for tech company in
Shanghai or many cities in China would be like endless crunching. Maybe I was
not used to this high-paced lifestyle, long working hours. Didn&rsquo;t like
javascript either. It is a pity that I didn&rsquo;t find a nicer job maybe opens to
better opportunities. I was focusing on the development of Taiwins back then,
well it is working now and I don&rsquo;t develop it anymore. The June was pretty
unproductive, ever since the ICL implant surgery I couldn&rsquo;t use computers for
long, even now it is painful to do so. At least I get more time reading books?</p>
<p>It is a pretty sad story, there were too many scope creeping, techlogical
decision changes last couple of years. Being able to work on this massive
project is challenging and rewarding but on the other hand, it is pretty damn
lonly too. I think no one else is really having geniune interest in it. It
maybe much more attractive if all the visionary features are complete. But it
may never be in that way though? Networkmanager seems to have a dbus API, but
then what about alsa? blue-z? You will need native API for them. So for the
widgets to really fly, you will need to support widgets through different
processes. The taiwins shell would require a total redesign.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">In my previous post, I&rsquo;ve somewhat found a way to synchronize my org files. I was pretty happy, I was having just around six org pages, coping them to a webdav server was not a huge hustle :P, util I started to use org-roam. Suddenly I have to create org file for every new zettle, the performance quickly started to tank. This is probably the beauty and curse of using open source solutions &mdash; you have full control of your work and you have to solve problems you created yourself.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">It&rsquo;s been a while that I haven&rsquo;t update the blogs. It is so easy to slack off on good habits. &ldquo;Oh I will continue once I finish A B C&rdquo;. We are all busy as hell, in the software world, you WORK, you WORK and you GO TO SLEEP. Like this one, I am always hoping to switch to Hugo, then I can continue writing the blog. The thing is, I never got the good weekend to do the switching.</p>
