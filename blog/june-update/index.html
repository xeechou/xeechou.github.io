      <section class="post-content"><p>Montr√©al is hotter than ever in this month, under the broiling sun, it was an
exhausting quarantine. The first <a href="/blog/busy-in-quarantine">month</a> I
remeber I was feeling fortunate I got this aleatory chance for advancement of
<em>taiwins</em> in this global pandemic, right now all I felt was the painful
experience converting all the Taiwins server code away from
libweston. Implementating of server side wayland objects was indeed unpleasant
experience. Without libweston, I have to implement every little thing and get it
right, even the basics 2D homogenous matrix operations for coordinates
transformations. Just a days I ago I discovered my mistakenly used rotations in
the &ldquo;Y-up&rdquo; coordinate system (like OpenGL) in the &ldquo;Y-down&rdquo; coordinate sytem
(like Wayland protocol). The good news was that I did not give up, it seemed I
overcame one difficulties after another, now at least I can paint my taiwins
shell objects using a primitive renderer. In the end, hopefully I will end-up
with a working and cleaner compositor library than <em>libweston</em>. This is
certainly an encouraging news as I used to think a compositor library was not
possible to finish with only two hands.</p>
<p>Aside from crunching for taiwins, there wasn&rsquo;t much going on. Are we going out
of this pandemic or expecting a second wave?  Will we have a vaccine? I heard
the virus has mutated, would the vaccine still be valid when it came out? This
pandemic is certainly unprecendented for this generation, people are graduating
online. global airlines are pratically dead. The city is half live and half
dead. Just when you thought things are getting better then recently the massive
<em>BLM</em> protests took on. So nope, we are going violent and chaotic all the
way. Sadly I may leave Montreal for good this year. It felt like a relationship
turned south, When I grab my luggage and get on the airplane a few month later,
it would not be much a pleasant goodbye. Maybe I am too dramatic here, this is
merely the aftermath of this exhausting pendamic, I am tired inside out. At
least the stocking market is going rocket high right? Well, anyway, I guess
there are many things we have no control over, I only hope we will coming out
stronger.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">You need a wayland compositor library to create a wayland server. Wayland is a protocol, itself, cannot do much, long time ago I used to think the server-side wl_resource represents some structure you can operate on, well it turned out all you do with it is handling messages between client and server. All the logic you need to implement yourself.
There were a few attempts to wayland compositing library created. The first sucessful one is wlc.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">July, the hottest month in Montreal every year. The heat wave rushes to you when you walk outside makes you wondering if you are in some tropical island, it sure doesn&rsquo;t look like living at 45 latitde northen hemisphere. Last month was a rapid leap towards wayland objects implementations and now I just hitted the wall of xdg-shell protocol. Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about what it is like to implement a wayland protocol.</p>
