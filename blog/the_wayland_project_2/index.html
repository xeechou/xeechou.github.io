      <section class="post-content"><p>The last <a href="%7Bfilename%7D/the_wayland_project.md">post</a> I laid out the story of me
with wayland. Technology is fascinating isn&rsquo;t it? Every once a while, there are
plenty of new projects that aim to start an revolution, getting people
excited. Projects like <strong>systemd</strong>, <strong>Wayland</strong>, <strong>Vulkan</strong> make us think how
come we did not think of those before, they seemed perfect at the
moment. Technologies always work like a rush of hot wave, our sights are limited
at the moment we are in, maybe 5 years from now, even <strong>vulkan</strong> is not sexy
anymore. For ten years, community has been urging everyone to jump on the boat
of wayland. Some major platform adopted it, just there is no money in it. Major
platforms like <strong>GNOME</strong> and <strong>KDE</strong> are not even mature yet, KDE developers
also worries about the future of the wayland, will it last 30 years like <strong>X
window</strong>?</p>
<p>One of the truth that almost nobody talks about is that we all try to advertize
the vague new technology as easy-to-learn, benifits and ignore all the learning
curves. Is it really so? How many simple ideas out there that can rock the
world? I cannot judge, in the context of <strong>wayland</strong> project. I cannot really
use the word <em>facile</em>. The knowledge required for a wayland compositor is far
more than what presented in
<a href="https://github.com/cdown/dwm/blob/master/dwm.c">DWM</a>. Wayland is merely a
<strong>IPC</strong> protocol library, all the work such as mapping hardware to logic
devices, rendering and compositing has to done by a compositor writer. Even with
the library <strong>libweston</strong>, programmers are still exposed by all those concepts.
If you step on the path to do it all yourself, you will need quite a massive
knowledge under the belt, I&rsquo;d say. But let&rsquo;s not discourage everyone. Let&rsquo;s talk
about all the goodies of wayland tech, especially the <strong>libweston</strong> could offer.</p>
<h2 id="the-input">The input</h2>
<p>The first thing that I started with the <strong>libweston</strong> is actually learning
<strong>xkbcommon</strong>(xkbcommon itself has the concepts like <code>keymap</code>, <code>modifier</code>,
<code>keysym</code> and so on). I was trying to implement a complex keyboard mapping,
supporting sequence keybindings. It works a bit like what is available in emacs,
only I have to hack around the <code>libweston</code>&rsquo;s flat keyboard handler. After
registering the keybinding callbacks, compositor will route the key events to
the clients when they are in focus.</p>
<p>Another idea exposed is the <strong>seat</strong>, it is presented in the wayland core
protocol as well. Unix system has this concept called <strong>seat</strong>. A seat is a set
of input device like keyboard, mice or controller, it means adding a seat for a
user to user, how to discouver and group input devices into seats is transparent
in the libweston, what programmer has is a signal handler. once a new seat
discovered, compositor can setup the <code>keymap</code> and other things.</p>
<h2 id="the-view-and-surface">The view and surface</h2>
<p>The <code>view</code> and the <code>surface</code> are the core concept in the weston
composition. Basically <code>weston_surface</code> contains the buffer, but <code>weston_view</code>
determines where you will show the surface on the screen. In the current weston
architecture, at every frame, weston will build up a list of views and render
them on top of each other. You can play all kinds of tricks with view, like
rotations and scaling.</p>
<h2 id="weston_output-and-weston_layer"><code>weston_output</code> and <code>weston_layer</code></h2>
<p>The next concepts is the layer, this is idea when you want to futher seperate
compositing into layers of cake. For example, on the top of your layers, you
would have your cursor, then you may have some ui elements. futher downwards,
you may have your regular windows section, then at the bottom, there is the
wallpaper. If your GPU supports multiple planes, you can take the advantage of
it to composite only certain layers and leaves the rest unchange, your wouldn&rsquo;t
want to redraw everything just for the small motion of cursor, right :p?</p>
<p>What about <code>weston_output</code>? Output is the monitor, but technically it is a view
of your entire framebuffer. If you have two monitors side-by-side, one
output (monitor) occupies a chunk of that framebuffer. In this design, we only
need to composite one framebuffer, and you can move the windows from one monitor
to another at ease.</p>
<h2 id="other-wayland-concepts">Other wayland concepts</h2>
<p>Wayland object is not easy to work with, first challenge is double buffer
state. Manage the state is quite lines of code actually. Many other objects like
<code>registry</code> and <code>wl_global</code> or <code>wl_seat</code> are easier and usually done with a
common routine (I guess that is why you would want Qt/GTK instead of barebone
wayland client).</p>
<p>But The most confusing concept I&rsquo;ve had is the <code>wl_surface_frame</code>. By reading the
wayland docs. Firstly I thought it was compulsory to do a buffer swap, once you
have your frame callback, you can do a rendering and commit. But if you really
do that, you would not be able to draw anything since <code>frame</code> only issues after
the <code>commit</code>. So you need to do a <code>wl_surface_frame</code>, then commit, then why do
you need the <code>wl_callback</code> later?  Just to delete it? This was how I drive my
wayland client for a long period. In turned out <code>wl_frame</code> is only useful for
the animations, but even though, you still need to have a first commit to drive
the next frame. If you are work with typical GUI element where you only need to
redraw at input events. The <code>frame</code> callback is totally unecessary. I <strong>only</strong>
realized it after reading through the libweston rendering pipeline.</p>
<p>So if you need to work on a wayland client, there are some traps like
this. Designing UIs under wayland is really far from easy, I would maybe write
another article about that part of the story.</p>
<h2 id="so-after-all-is-it-all-good">So after all, is it all good</h2>
<p>In the end, I have to say this. With help of libweston, the implemention of a
compositor is indeed much easier, it setup the <code>drm</code> and <code>gbm</code>, and implements
most of the core protocols like <code>wl_surface</code> <code>wl_buffer</code> on the sever side. What
it offers the compositor designer is a feature-rich apis to manipulate wayland
object, you can do almost everything you want. Only if you have a strong grasp
of all the concepts, so you can avoid all the traps that I as in. And
<strong>libweston</strong> has absolutely no documentation at all.</p>

5 years ago, I read a blog about the future of linux desktop, I was using a window manager called Awesome (one of my friend introduced it to me, I was enchanted by how he opened two terminals side-by-side, one for coding and one for compiling). A voice about next generation desktop was just raised in the linux community , a group of hackers demod the weston project, where you can rotate the application windows.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">Deferred MSAA, always has been a good problem. In the spatial anti-aliasing domain, MSAA is still the swiss-army knife, handle almost all the case.
Some other post-processing methods like nvidia&rsquo;s FXAA, AMDs MLAA, or DLAA. FXAA is rather pleasing in many cases as well, especially if you are a video game developer, as long as your rasterization implementation does not screwed up. But for the case like grass rendering, fur rendering, when you have many layers of thin line, FXAA will fail you.</p>
