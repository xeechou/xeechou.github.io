      <section class="post-content"><p>You need a wayland compositor library to create a wayland server. Wayland is a
protocol, itself, cannot do much, long time ago I used to think the server-side
<code>wl_resource</code> represents some structure you can operate on, well it turned out
all you do with it is handling messages between client and server. All the logic
you need to implement yourself.</p>
<p>There were a few attempts to wayland compositing library created. The first
sucessful one is <a href="https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc">wlc</a>. I think its existence is
that <a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/weston">weston</a> (the twin of the
wayland project, now maintained by Pekka Paalanen). was a monolith application
for a long time. Weston looks pretty and quite fast and beautiful but not very
useful to anyone else. The developers maybe realized that they want to get more
people to use weston, so they managed to strip <strong>libweston</strong> out of weston
itself. It was a good attempt, although I doubt their true intention was to
creating a reusable compositing library. Nonetheless, to some extent, it helped
the birth of the third library by Drew Devault, the
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>.</p>
<p>Over this month, I am trying to migrate from libweston. Over these years, I
slowly discovered that libweston has its hidden flaws that need to be patched, I
tried a few times to send Merge requests, now I lost my faith and gave up on
patching libweston. Well, it is hard to argue on a project you do not
maintain. The feature you thought would be important may not be the same for
others. The target platform, is the wlroots. This time however, I learned from
my previous mistake, a open source project is like a person, <em>you cannot expect
it to be something it has not been yet</em>. This time, I merely use wlroots as a
thin layer for hardware abstraction(if there is any good alternative I would
ditch wlroots for sure). Libliftoff looks like a good candidate, depends on if
it gets mature. Maybe in the end I would have to write one myself.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-view">A brief view</h3>
<p>Anyway, the purpose today is comparing <strong>libweston</strong> and <strong>wlroots</strong>. Though
Drew Devault claimed <strong>wlroots</strong> is a much better choice, I see them similar in
many ways, in implementing many protocols.</p>

<p>Though many types in <strong>libweston</strong> you can find correspondence in <strong>wlroots</strong>,
some of the implementation are also similar, eg, data-device, but you can also
find the significant difference. In <strong>libweston</strong>, you have the
<code>weston_compositor</code> as a middle layer, it does all the heavily lifting, as a
user, you would add decorations on top of it, for example, you could add some
callbacks on output creation. On the land of <strong>wlroots</strong>, you will be heavily
rely on <code>wl_signal</code>. The library notifies you when to do something , but to do
what and how to do is totally up-to-you. As good as it sounds, <strong>wlroots</strong> also
has its limitations, by design, you are almost forced to use none-or-all of its
types. <code>wlr_compositor</code> depends on <code>wlr_renderer</code>, <code>wlr_data_device</code> depends on
<code>wlr_seat</code>, the list goes on. Some of the dependencies to me were not necessary,
but again, if I propose to change it, highly likely would be rejected. Also, by
its design, <strong>wlroots</strong> implements similar protocols in different types, eg,
<code>xdg_shell</code>, <code>xdg_shell_v6</code> and <code>wl_shell</code>. You would have to deal with the
interface one-by-one, In libweston, they are nicely implemented together and it
exposed <code>libweston_desktop</code> API to you.</p>
<p>Now let us have a run using the two library, to get a more concrete idea.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-run-into-libweston">A quick run into libweston.</h3>
<p>You start by creating <code>wl_display</code> and creating <code>weston_compositor</code> object
first(it self already does quite a few things, implement many protocols). Before
waking the compositor, you would want to setting some listeners and signals on
<em>seat</em>, <em>output</em> creations. It is also the good time for adding the callbacks
for <code>libweston_desktop</code>.</p>
<p>Libweston comes with a few backend, like <code>drm_backend</code>, <code>x11_backend</code>,
<code>fbdev_backend</code>, those are the backends implements <code>weston_output</code> and
<code>weston_seat</code>. Choosing a backend before waking up compositor is necessary,
otherwise you would not process any events.</p>
<p>Now after After the waking of <code>weston_compositor</code>, before <code>wl_display_run</code>, you
can have very few additional setups on the compositor. <code>xkb_rules</code> are already
fixed, you cannot change the modes, or scale of enabled output. But you can
still create some <code>wl_globals</code> for your needs.</p>
<p>Finally, calling the <code>wl_display_run</code> would start processing the event queue.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-run-on-the-wlroots">A quick run on the wlroots.</h3>
<p>You start again, by creating <code>wl_display</code>, <strong>wlroots</strong> does not have a
compositor object, instead, you work with <code>wlr_backend</code>, it abstracts away the
hardware events and rendering callbacks. As metioned before, <strong>wlroots</strong> heavily
relies on signals, <code>wlr_backend</code> is a perfect example. By adding listeners to
events like <code>new_input</code> and <code>new_output</code>. You can handle objects like
<code>wlr_output</code> and <code>wlr_input_device</code>. Each of those objects has their own events,
such as <code>wlr_input_deivce.events</code> is used for input handling. You additionally
creating objects like <code>wlr_seat</code>(which is a protocol implementation) for
forwarding input events to your clients. This is a critical point actually, if
you decide to go with <strong>wlroots</strong> objects, from this point you will need to go
all the way. If you decide to implement your own wayland interfaces, you can
forget all the types like <code>wlr_seat</code>, <code>wlr_surface</code>, <code>wlr_compositor</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Back on the topic, in creating the <code>wlr_backend</code>, you also would want to create
your own renderer or not, <strong>wlroots</strong> comes with a very renderer. After all
those objects created, press the button <code>wlr_backend_start</code> for launching the
compositor, a bit similar to <code>weston_compositor_wake</code> right? If nothing goes
wrong, you would see a window by now.</p>
<p>There are many other details needed to filled, since <strong>wlroots</strong> is a modular
library, every protocol you want to support needs to be added explicitly, you
probably want a <code>xdg_shell</code> for example.</p>
<p>In the end, call <code>wl_display_run</code> to start the event queue.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I hope this article would be useful for getting an idea about wayland compositor
librarys. There are some design I preferred in <strong>libweston</strong> but in general I
would prefer the modular design of <strong>wlroots</strong>, it looks much less
intimidating. You can understand a type at a time, Where in libweston, every c
file in libweston is like a few thousands lines long, understanding the project
and adding modification is difficult, though it is a more mature project.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">wl_data_device interface in the base wayland protocol is the most complex one, in my opinion, wayland.xml explains it fairly well, but every pieces are scattered in the file, here I serialize it together, give you quick run through.
In brief, data device in wayland consists of four interfaces: The first is wl_data_device_manager, it is the global. The second is wl_data_device, can be created from wl_data_device_manager for a given seat, it is used to set selection(ctrl-c ctrl-v) and drag-n-drop.</p>

The first month I remeber I was feeling fortunate I got this aleatory chance for advancement of taiwins in this global pandemic, right now all I felt was the painful experience converting all the Taiwins server code away from libweston. Implementating of server side wayland objects was indeed unpleasant experience. Without libweston, I have to implement every little thing and get it right, even the basics 2D homogenous matrix operations for coordinates transformations.</p>
