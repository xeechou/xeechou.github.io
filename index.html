        For a long time I&rsquo;ve been wanting to Migrate my blog system from Pelican to Hugo. One reason is that I had enough with python virtual environment breaks every 3 months. Another motivation is obviously I would like to replace Python with Go in my life.
A long time ago I followed Go tutorial for getting started, surprised by its syntax tidiness and similarity to Python, and it is way faster.

        It&rsquo;s been a while that I haven&rsquo;t update the blogs. It is so easy to slack off on good habits. &ldquo;Oh I will continue once I finish A B C&rdquo;. We are all busy as hell, in the software world, you WORK, you WORK and you GO TO SLEEP. Like this one, I am always hoping to switch to Hugo, then I can continue writing the blog. The thing is, I never got the good weekend to do the switching.

        I am now back in Canada, quarantined again. There is much of internal struggle whether I should move back or stay in Shanghai? Working for tech company in Shanghai or many cities in China would be like endless crunching. Maybe I was not used to this high-paced lifestyle, long working hours. Didn&rsquo;t like javascript either. It is a pity that I didn&rsquo;t find a nicer job maybe opens to better opportunities.

        In my previous post, I&rsquo;ve somewhat found a way to synchronize my org files. I was pretty happy, I was having just around six org pages, coping them to a webdav server was not a huge hustle :P, util I started to use org-roam. Suddenly I have to create org file for every new zettle, the performance quickly started to tank. This is probably the beauty and curse of using open source solutions &mdash; you have full control of your work and you have to solve problems you created yourself.

        Static site generator, I love and hate them at the sametime. They really render your markdowns into a beautiful website without need of knowing web technologies. Then there are the constant hustles once you try to customize it, change a theme, adding different functionalities or upgrade. It is YOUR website, you want it look different than others, right. At some point, whether you like it or not, the SSG users will take the role of website designers by tangling with CSS.

        If there is one thing I&rsquo;d like to commit it must be the my time mangement improvements. For that purpose, Emacs Org-mode is the ultimate tool for programmers. I can keep my notes nicely and I can track my tasks/errands all together. But all my notes are stored in my linux box, I lose access to them once I am away. From that reason, I was always on-and-off with using org-mode due to the portability.

        I hate every single line of xwayland code I wrote, it is ugly, long and hard to maintain. Now I know very well why there is wayland in the first place, sadly a complete wayland compositor has to bring a piece of crap of X with it. I just finished the selection handling in xwayland by mimicing weston code. After finally understand that 1000 lines of confusing code, I just found out I can&rsquo;t do any better.

        Folks, the Magical year of 2020 is behind us, and it wasn&rsquo;t a happy new chapter waiting us. Man, I still couldn&rsquo;t believe, once per 100 years, why it was us who have to face the coronavirus. Now I take a good look of my 2020, I went from trying to submit a xcbcommon handling patch to weston to writing a full wayland compositor from scratch. It was not my plan!

        In the first blog of libdrm, we went through the repainting loop using the libdrm. Now we move on to the topic of framebuffers. A framebuffer is a piece of memory (could be on main memory or on GPU) for repainting every frame. It is like a canvas, represents what you would finally see on screen. Framebuffer is already a familiar concept to rendering programmers, in OpenGL, We have GL_FRAMEBUFFER_0 for presenting the surface, additional framebuffers for roles like G-Buffer and post-processing.

        As the taiwins project finished with X11/Wayland backend rigging. Now I am fully on the libdrm backend development, dealing with hardwares directly. This backend requires 200 percent my energy to tame the complexity.
Like other backends, libdrm also needs to provide two resources, input and output. Backends like nested wayland backend or X11 backend, the output device are the windows created by ourselves (or by the user). Meaning we can create it or destroy it as we please.
