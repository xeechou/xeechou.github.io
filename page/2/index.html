        <p>We were using a traditional <code>for_each</code> style drawing G-buffer and shadow in Vulkan, with over 2.5 million triangles, and 25,000+ objects, I started to see my GTX 1650 having hard time following it up. Although you can pre-record command buffers in Vulkan to reduce the CPU time but we will also end up with a very large command buffer to submit and potentially miss the driver optimizations with indirect draws. These days, GPUs are getting more and more powerful and complex, including tons of new features. It&rsquo;s promising to draw millions or billions more triangles compared to before. The cost is that it changed the programming paradigm completely. If you want embark on new hardware, chances are you need to rewrite the rendering code.</p>

There are indeed many people tried to implement a rendering framework on top of Vulkan to reduce the amount of code to write. But so many of them merely just create a wrapper around existing Vulkan objects, like wrapping the command buffer with a <code>vk::CommandBuffer::Ptr</code>  and you still have to fill all the <code>VkObjCreateInfos</code> .</p>
<p>
The rendering framework focus on the render passes should provide a compact yet descriptive API to create render pass. Leaving the user out of the mess of managing/binding descriptors, uniform buffers. Have them focus on the shaders.</p>

        <p>My blog is now back online, with brand new render engine Hugo. The URLs are
totally different though. Not sure how web crawlers handling it right
now.</p>
<p>After the migration, I did a few extra work for patching the hiccups. Fix the
build warnings and adding new features.</p>
<h3 id="the-about-page">The about page</h3>
<p>In every blog you always have some pages that you do not want it be inside the
blog list. By default Hugo will simply place everything on the &ldquo;navigation
list&rdquo;. Even if I place it outside the blog folder. This is the list your
template is calling <code>.NextPage</code> and <code>.PrevPage</code>. So initially I just give it a
very old date, or simply removed the date, so it will appear as the last on the
list. Obviously I will have to fix that.</p>

        <p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been wanting to Migrate my blog system from
<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. One
reason is that I had enough with python virtual environment breaks every 3
months. Another motivation is obviously I would like to replace Python with Go
in my life.</p>
<p>A long time ago I followed Go tutorial for getting started, surprised by its
syntax tidiness and similarity to Python, and it is way faster. But soon I
found out it would be one of this thing I learned for a weekend and forget all
together, since I don&rsquo;t have any projects I would use it actively. Now after
one month of procrastination, I finally pieces ALMOST everything to reproduce
my old blog. Time for a summary.</p>

        <p>I am now back in Canada, quarantined again. There is much of internal struggle
whether I should move back or stay in Shanghai? Working for tech company in
Shanghai or many cities in China would be like endless crunching. Maybe I was
not used to this high-paced lifestyle, long working hours. Didn&rsquo;t like
javascript either. It is a pity that I didn&rsquo;t find a nicer job maybe opens to
better opportunities. I was focusing on the development of Taiwins back then,
well it is working now and I don&rsquo;t develop it anymore. The June was pretty
unproductive, ever since the ICL implant surgery I couldn&rsquo;t use computers for
long, even now it is painful to do so. At least I get more time reading books?</p>

        <p>Static site generator, I love and hate them at the sametime. They really render
your markdowns into a beautiful website without need of knowing web
technologies. Then there are the constant hustles once you try to customize it,
change a theme, adding different functionalities or upgrade. It is YOUR
website, you want it look different than others, right. At some point, whether
you like it or not, the SSG users will take the role of website designers by
tangling with CSS.</p>
