	<section class="post-content"><p>In the <a href="%7Bfilename%7D/drm-backend.md">first blog of libdrm</a>, we went through the
repainting loop using the libdrm. Now we move on to the topic of
framebuffers. A framebuffer is a piece of memory (could be on main memory or on
GPU) for repainting every frame. It is like a canvas, represents what you would
finally see on screen. Framebuffer is already a familiar concept to rendering
programmers, in <strong>OpenGL</strong>, We have <code>GL_FRAMEBUFFER_0</code> for presenting the
surface, additional framebuffers for roles like G-Buffer and
post-processing. In GPU programming, framebuffer is also a broader concept,
&ldquo;abstraction of a collection of attachments&rdquo;, the underlining attachments
corresponds to actual pieces of memory we talk about here.</p>
<h3 id="dumb-buffer">Dumb buffer</h3>
<p>Back to our topic, we have two options for allocating framebuffers for
libdrm. The <strong>first</strong> is through dumb buffer, a slow, linear, in main memory
buffer. Creating that, we have <code>drmioctl(fd, DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB, &amp;req)</code>. the <code>req</code> argument here specifies parameters like the width, height,
pitch, bit-per-pixel. For retriving a framebuffer handle, libdrm provides
function <code>drmModeAddFB(fd, width, height, depth, ...)</code>. <strong>Then</strong> we map the
buffer though good old <code>mmap</code> function and do all kinds of magic on it, very
1990s ish. <strong>Finally</strong>, having the fb handle, we would use either
<code>drmModeSetCrtc</code> or <code>drmModePageFlip</code> to present that buffer on screen.</p>
<h3 id="gbm-buffers">GBM buffers</h3>
<p>The second method is through device GEM buffers, they are usually the GPU
memory, supports compression, modifiers and of course, GPU commands. In the
open source world, Mesa project provides a generic <code>libgbm</code> for vendor agnostic
allocations, we get framebuffer handle from libgbm through the <code>gbm_bo</code>
object. libgbm is rather flexible, for getting the <code>gbm_bo</code>s. We can either go
with the traditional method, allocating <code>gbm_surface</code> and getting the buffers
through <code>gbm_surface_lock_front_buffer</code>, or we can mannually creating them with
<code>gbm_bo_create[_with_modifiers]</code>. The first approach reflects to the OpenGL
rendering api, A <code>gbm_surface</code> maps to a <code>EGLSurface</code>,
<code>gbm_surface_lock_front_buffer</code> can only be called after <code>eglSwapBuffers</code>. The
disadvantage is obvious as well, it is tied to the <code>OpenGL</code> pipeline and we have no
control of how many <code>gbm_bo</code>s to allocate. As it is tied to <code>OpenGL</code>
pipeline. In Vulkan, there is no mapping of <code>VKSurfaceKHR</code> to GBM, for that, we
will go through the details later.</p>
<h3 id="eglstream">EGLStream</h3>
<p><code>EGLStream</code> is the Nvidia&rsquo;s proprietary approach on supporting libdrm, as
apparently they don&rsquo;t use GEM buffers, they came up with this <code>EGLStream</code> stack
for working with their driver blob. It is not simply a buffer allocation API as
it also introduces <code>EGLDeviceEXT</code>, <code>EGLOutputLayerEXT</code>. Using <code>EGLStream</code>,
there are fixed steps to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>discovering</strong> an <code>EGLDeviceEXT</code> which supports drm flags,</li>
<li><strong>getting</strong> a <code>EGLDisplay</code> from opened device using
<code>EGL_DRM_MASTER_FD_EXT</code>.</li>
<li><strong>creating</strong> a <code>EGLStreamKHR</code>,</li>
<li><strong>getting</strong> an output layer(plane) using <code>eglGetOutputLayersEXT</code>.</li>
<li><strong>attach</strong> plane as consumer using <code>eglStreamConsumerOutputEXT</code>.</li>
<li><strong>creating</strong> <code>EGLSurface</code> with the <code>eglCreateStreamProducerSurfaceKHR</code> as
the producer.</li>
<li><strong>driving</strong> pageflipping using <code>eglStreamConsumerAcquireAttribNV</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="vulkan-workflow">Vulkan workflow</h3>
<p>Vulkan has its own path in supporing direct compositing. On Vulkan side, there
is an extension called <code>VK_DISPLAY_KHR</code>, very much like the <code>EGLStream</code>
extension, trying to do everying inside vulkan. You can create a <code>VkSurface</code>
with <code>VkDisplayKHR</code> through <code>vkCreateDisplayPlaneSurfaceKHR</code>, once you have the
surface, everything else would look like a typical Vulkan application as
well. The downsides is that you also lose access of direct modesetting control
like <code>drmModeSetCrtc</code> or <code>drmPageFlip</code>, and there is no plane assignment. If
you were previously using libdrm, it also means you need to
throw-the-code-out-of-window. It is a viable approach if you decide to go with
Vulkan and only Vulkan, as some
<a href="https://themaister.net/blog/2018/07/02/improving-vk_khr_display-in-mesa-or-lets-make-drm-better/">people</a>
prefer this approach but not every one. For people wanting an alternative
way(Vulkan + KMS WSI), The journal of the discussion is
<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/294">here</a>. The problem is
that unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is an &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; API, As <strong>tomek-brcm</strong> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently GLES/EGL implemntation of Wayland compositor and clients is based on
a silent assumption that driver has an implicit cross-process
synchronisation. This is not GLES or EGL requirement, just an unwrittenWayland
assumption. Vulkan is all about explicit synchronisation that isresponsibility
of an application but it doesn&rsquo;t provide any cross-processsynchronisation
primitives. This is, to my untrained eye, a blocker issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We get the client buffer on the <code>wl_surface.commit</code> but there is no guarantee
what-so-ever about client has finished drawing. If a wayland server has to wait
on a fence every time a client commits a buffer. It is probably not very
usable. Luckly the issue was resolved through the <code>VK_KHR_external_*_extension</code>
when Vulkan lands on 1.1. <em>They enable the implementation of all the Vulkan WSI
mechanisms/extensions on top of core Vulkan + the OS-specific parts of external
objects</em>.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt"><p>As the taiwins project finished with X11/Wayland backend rigging. Now I am fully
on the libdrm backend development, dealing with hardwares directly. This backend
requires 200 percent my energy to tame the complexity.</p>
<p>Like other backends, libdrm also needs to provide two resources, <em>input</em> and
<em>output</em>. Backends like nested wayland backend or X11 backend, the <em>output</em>
device are the windows created by ourselves (or by the user). Meaning we can
create it or destroy it as we please. As for libdrm, those are provided by the
OS. An <em>output</em> in libdrm&rsquo;s terminology, is called connector. We query and
change the connectors state by <code>drmModeGet*</code> functions. Then later set the
hardware states by <code>drmModeSet*</code> or the new atomic API. It may sound simple but
actually, for displaying images on the screen using the <em>libdrm</em> mechanism, it
takes quite a few components, working together, to achieve the goal. We uses
<code>drmMode*</code> routines for
<a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/drm-kms.html">kernel-modesetting</a>;
libgbm for framebuffer allocation; OpenGL or Vulkan for rendering. If done
right, you would get tear-free images on your screen constant refresh rate. But
should anything goes wrong, you probably end up with a black screen.</p></p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt"><p>Folks, the Magical year of 2020 is behind us, and it wasn&rsquo;t a happy new chapter
waiting us. Man, I still couldn&rsquo;t believe, once per 100 years, why it was us
who have to face the coronavirus. Now I take a good look of my 2020, I went
from trying to submit a xcbcommon handling patch to weston to writing a full
wayland compositor from scratch. It was not my plan!!! Taiwins should have
being a rather simple application on top of the libweston, the so called
&ldquo;reference compositor &ldquo;, but libweston cannot change keyboard layout once
launching, nor it can support cloning output, there are new bugs when you
digging deep. The worst is that it breaks the library into different shared
modules, and changes lib location every release. It was like it really does not
want to link to it. The codebase was old and long, it was difficult to make a
change and really difficult to get libweston taking a patch. Then there is the
wlroots. If it was released half year earlier Taiwins would probably sit on top
of that. But, screw it. I am doing it myself.</p></p>
