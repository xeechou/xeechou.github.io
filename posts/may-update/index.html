      <section class="post-content"><p>Forcing a monthly blog update seems to be a good idea, giving myself a reason to
keep paying for this Domain. Also, I don&rsquo;t usually has a topic to address
specifically, a monthly update can fill this role. Anyway, time passes rapidly
in quarantine my friends. I hope a few years forward when I look back at this
moment, I would not feel I wasted so much time. I don&rsquo;t actually feel I made
much progress through this month. I would say, I am digging into my memory right
now, it is hard to recall much in detail. yeah, that is life in quarantine,
&ldquo;stagnation&rdquo;, like the blackwater.</p>
<p>Excepting that I announced taiwins on the wayland mailing list. It was,
suprising I would say, more precisely, I didn&rsquo;t have any idea what would
happen. I got a handful people stared my project. I guess there are quite a few
people be interested in switching to wayland, but unfortunately there were no
people showed up much interest in helping developing it(let me be wrong please),
which I obviously need the most. <strong>Taiwins</strong> was my quiet little personal
project for this long(and also my biggest social life barrier, on the other
hand), my father said it would be waste of time if nobody would use it. Maybe
taiwins is that window manager that only fits my niche? I only hope later when
it is more mature, I will be proved wrong. At this point, If I have to make a
judgement, I think taiwins would be more like a lightweight DE like <strong>Xfce</strong> and
<strong>lxde</strong> than compact window manager like <strong>i3wm</strong>, I would say in
between. Would that be a niche market? Only time will tell I guess. Right now
taiwins is far from a daily drive. I have to push it forward, next feature would
be <code>primary-selection</code> and real useful website. Another thing I need to think
right now is switching to use wlroots, it would be a painful refactoring. But it
looks like libweston is really not going to the way I hoped.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that I started to implement the animations
system, wow this is the hell-I-remember many times I have to review on
quaternions. And its interpolations. Interpolating multiple quaternion samples
is hell of a job. How do I find the derivatives of quaternions anyway? Next step
would be finishing the cubic and bezier interpolations on quaternions, before I
can move to skinning.</p>
<p>Well, until next time.</p>

Be able to update blogs is always my pursuit, unfortunately there were always more code to write. It has been more than one year, last time I was still on how to MSAA on OpenGL 4, somehow it felt like a decade ago. The peaceful developing world took an interesting turn.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">wl_data_device interface in the base wayland protocol is the most complex one, in my opinion, wayland.xml explains it fairly well, but every pieces are scattered in the file, here I serialize it together, give you quick run through.
In brief, data device in wayland consists of four interfaces: The first is wl_data_device_manager, it is the global. The second is wl_data_device, can be created from wl_data_device_manager for a given seat, it is used to set selection(ctrl-c ctrl-v) and drag-n-drop.</p>
