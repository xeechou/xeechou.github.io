        <p>I am now back in Canada, quarantined again. There is much of internal struggle
whether I should move back or stay in Shanghai? Working for tech company in
Shanghai or many cities in China would be like endless crunching. Maybe I was
not used to this high-paced lifestyle, long working hours. Didn&rsquo;t like
javascript either. It is a pity that I didn&rsquo;t find a nicer job maybe opens to
better opportunities. I was focusing on the development of Taiwins back then,
well it is working now and I don&rsquo;t develop it anymore. The June was pretty
unproductive, ever since the ICL implant surgery I couldn&rsquo;t use computers for
long, even now it is painful to do so. At least I get more time reading books?</p>

        <p>In my previous <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/back-with-org-mode/">post</a>, I&rsquo;ve somewhat found
a way to synchronize my org files. I was pretty happy, I was having just around
six org pages, coping them to a <strong>webdav</strong> server was not a huge hustle :P,
util I started to use <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html">org-roam</a>. Suddenly
I have to create org file for every new

of using open source solutions &mdash; you have full control of your work and you
have to solve problems you created yourself.</p>

        <p>Static site generator, I love and hate them at the sametime. They really render
your markdowns into a beautiful website without need of knowing web
technologies. Then there are the constant hustles once you try to customize it,
change a theme, adding different functionalities or upgrade. It is YOUR
website, you want it look different than others, right. At some point, whether
you like it or not, the SSG users will take the role of website designers by
tangling with CSS.</p>

        <p>If there is one thing I&rsquo;d like to commit it must be the my time mangement
improvements. For that purpose, Emacs Org-mode is the <strong>ultimate</strong> tool for
programmers. I can keep my notes nicely and I can track my tasks/errands all
together. But all my notes are stored in my linux box, I lose access to them
once I am away. From that reason, I was always on-and-off with using org-mode
due to the portability. We are not in the age doing everything with desktop
anymore, more often I need to track my TODOs from cellphone as well.</p>

        <p>I hate every single line of xwayland code I wrote, it is ugly, long and hard to
maintain. Now I know very well why there is wayland in the first place, sadly a
complete wayland compositor has to bring a piece of crap of X with it. I just
finished the selection handling in xwayland by mimicing weston code. After
finally understand that 1000 lines of confusing code, I just found out I can&rsquo;t

        <p>Folks, the Magical year of 2020 is behind us, and it wasn&rsquo;t a happy new chapter
waiting us. Man, I still couldn&rsquo;t believe, once per 100 years, why it was us
who have to face the coronavirus. Now I take a good look of my 2020, I went
from trying to submit a xcbcommon handling patch to weston to writing a full
wayland compositor from scratch. It was not my plan!!! Taiwins should have
being a rather simple application on top of the libweston, the so called
&ldquo;reference compositor &ldquo;, but libweston cannot change keyboard layout once
launching, nor it can support cloning output, there are new bugs when you
digging deep. The worst is that it breaks the library into different shared
modules, and changes lib location every release. It was like it really does not
want to link to it. The codebase was old and long, it was difficult to make a
change and really difficult to get libweston taking a patch. Then there is the
wlroots. If it was released half year earlier Taiwins would probably sit on top
of that. But, screw it. I am doing it myself.</p>

        <p>In the <a href="%7Bfilename%7D/drm-backend.md">first blog of libdrm</a>, we went through the
repainting loop using the libdrm. Now we move on to the topic of
framebuffers. A framebuffer is a piece of memory (could be on main memory or on
GPU) for repainting every frame. It is like a canvas, represents what you would
finally see on screen. Framebuffer is already a familiar concept to rendering
programmers, in <strong>OpenGL</strong>, We have <code>GL_FRAMEBUFFER_0</code> for presenting the
surface, additional framebuffers for roles like G-Buffer and
post-processing. In GPU programming, framebuffer is also a broader concept,
&ldquo;abstraction of a collection of attachments&rdquo;, the underlining attachments
corresponds to actual pieces of memory we talk about here.</p>

        <p>As the taiwins project finished with X11/Wayland backend rigging. Now I am fully
on the libdrm backend development, dealing with hardwares directly. This backend
requires 200 percent my energy to tame the complexity.</p>
<p>Like other backends, libdrm also needs to provide two resources, <em>input</em> and
<em>output</em>. Backends like nested wayland backend or X11 backend, the <em>output</em>
device are the windows created by ourselves (or by the user). Meaning we can
create it or destroy it as we please. As for libdrm, those are provided by the
OS. An <em>output</em> in libdrm&rsquo;s terminology, is called connector. We query and
change the connectors state by <code>drmModeGet*</code> functions. Then later set the
hardware states by <code>drmModeSet*</code> or the new atomic API. It may sound simple but
actually, for displaying images on the screen using the <em>libdrm</em> mechanism, it
takes quite a few components, working together, to achieve the goal. We uses
<code>drmMode*</code> routines for
<a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/drm-kms.html">kernel-modesetting</a>;
libgbm for framebuffer allocation; OpenGL or Vulkan for rendering. If done
right, you would get tear-free images on your screen constant refresh rate. But
should anything goes wrong, you probably end up with a black screen.</p>

        <p>It is a sunny day, somehow I got up early this morning. The cool, chilling
breath of air reminded me we are at the tail of the summer. It felt so strange,
this summer was like it was never here. Hiking, go swimming, taking a trips and
night outs. all those experiences for a normal summer I would do, they are all
absent, hope I don&rsquo;t regret too much for crunching code at home all these
months. It was a tough year actually, I was determined to push Taiwins to a
usable state, it has been stressful. Every time I look at the pile of the TODO
list, a sentiment of endless development and desperate hit me hard like a heart
attack. I had to work <strong>a lot</strong> to stay healthy.</p>
