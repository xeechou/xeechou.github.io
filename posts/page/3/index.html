        <p>July, the hottest month in Montreal every year. The heat wave rushes to you when
you walk outside makes you wondering if you are in some tropical island, it sure
doesn&rsquo;t look like living at 45 latitde northen hemisphere. Last month was a
rapid leap towards wayland objects implementations and now I just hitted the
wall of <code>xdg-shell</code> protocol. Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about what it is like to
implement a wayland protocol.</p>

        <p>Montr√©al is hotter than ever in this month, under the broiling sun, it was an
exhausting quarantine. The first <a href="/blog/busy-in-quarantine">month</a> I
remeber I was feeling fortunate I got this aleatory chance for advancement of
<em>taiwins</em> in this global pandemic, right now all I felt was the painful
experience converting all the Taiwins server code away from
libweston. Implementating of server side wayland objects was indeed unpleasant
experience. Without libweston, I have to implement every little thing and get it
right, even the basics 2D homogenous matrix operations for coordinates
transformations. Just a days I ago I discovered my mistakenly used rotations in
the &ldquo;Y-up&rdquo; coordinate system (like OpenGL) in the &ldquo;Y-down&rdquo; coordinate sytem
(like Wayland protocol). The good news was that I did not give up, it seemed I
overcame one difficulties after another, now at least I can paint my taiwins
shell objects using a primitive renderer. In the end, hopefully I will end-up
with a working and cleaner compositor library than <em>libweston</em>. This is
certainly an encouraging news as I used to think a compositor library was not
possible to finish with only two hands.</p>

        <p>You need a wayland compositor library to create a wayland server. Wayland is a
protocol, itself, cannot do much, long time ago I used to think the server-side
<code>wl_resource</code> represents some structure you can operate on, well it turned out
all you do with it is handling messages between client and server. All the logic
you need to implement yourself.</p>
<p>There were a few attempts to wayland compositing library created. The first
sucessful one is <a href="https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc">wlc</a>. I think its existence is
that <a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/weston">weston</a> (the twin of the
wayland project, now maintained by Pekka Paalanen). was a monolith application
for a long time. Weston looks pretty and quite fast and beautiful but not very
useful to anyone else. The developers maybe realized that they want to get more
people to use weston, so they managed to strip <strong>libweston</strong> out of weston
itself. It was a good attempt, although I doubt their true intention was to
creating a reusable compositing library. Nonetheless, to some extent, it helped
the birth of the third library by Drew Devault, the
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>.</p>

        <p><code>wl_data_device</code> interface in the base wayland protocol is the most complex one,
in my opinion, <em>wayland.xml</em> explains it fairly well, but every pieces are
scattered in the file, here I serialize it together, give you quick run through.</p>
<p>In brief, data device in wayland consists of four interfaces: The first is
<code>wl_data_device_manager</code>, it is the global. The second is <code>wl_data_device</code>,
can be created from <code>wl_data_device_manager</code> for a given seat, it is used to
set selection(ctrl-c ctrl-v) and drag-n-drop. The 3rd is <code>wl_data_source</code>,
also created from <code>wl_data_device_manager</code>, this source will be either a
selection source or drag-n-drop source. The last is <code>wl_data_offer</code>, which is
used for copying data from <code>wl_data_source</code>.</p>

        <p>Forcing a monthly blog update seems to be a good idea, giving myself a reason to
keep paying for this Domain. Also, I don&rsquo;t usually has a topic to address
specifically, a monthly update can fill this role. Anyway, time passes rapidly
in quarantine my friends. I hope a few years forward when I look back at this
moment, I would not feel I wasted so much time. I don&rsquo;t actually feel I made
much progress through this month. I would say, I am digging into my memory right
now, it is hard to recall much in detail. yeah, that is life in quarantine,

        <p>I update this blog less frequent than once per year, which sometimes makes me
question why do I keep paying for this site. Be able to update blogs is always
my pursuit, unfortunately there were always more code to write. It has been more
than one year, last time I was still on how to MSAA on OpenGL 4, somehow it felt
like a decade ago. The peaceful developing world took an interesting turn. A
long run bull market is killed and NYSE triggered circuit break 4 times in 10
days. People are joking they now have 75% of Warren Buffet&rsquo;s experience. Will
this gonna be the story we told our grand children born after 2020? &ldquo;You know
back in 2020, it was a crazy year&hellip;&rdquo;. We just saw the quarter of it, I am kind
of expecting the crazier in the rest, will it be massive unemployment and a
scary recession will be waiting? This week the market has recovered a bit of its
confidence somehow, despite the Covid-19 cases are surging. A friend used to
tell me, it would be a point where many will be killed by the virus and people
just don&rsquo;t care anymore, looks like the market is at that point.</p>

        <p>Deferred MSAA, always has been a good problem. In the spatial anti-aliasing
domain, MSAA is still the swiss-army knife, handle almost all the case.</p>
<p>Some other post-processing methods like nvidia&rsquo;s FXAA, AMDs MLAA, or DLAA. FXAA
is rather pleasing in many cases as well, especially if
you are a video game developer, as long as your rasterization implementation
does not screwed up. But for the case like grass rendering, fur rendering, when
you have many layers of thin line, FXAA will fail you. Just like the pixels
annotated in the image below.</p>

with wayland. Technology is fascinating isn&rsquo;t it? Every once a while, there are
plenty of new projects that aim to start an revolution, getting people
excited. Projects like <strong>systemd</strong>, <strong>Wayland</strong>, <strong>Vulkan</strong> make us think how
come we did not think of those before, they seemed perfect at the
moment. Technologies always work like a rush of hot wave, our sights are limited
at the moment we are in, maybe 5 years from now, even <strong>vulkan</strong> is not sexy
anymore. For ten years, community has been urging everyone to jump on the boat
of wayland. Some major platform adopted it, just there is no money in it. Major
platforms like <strong>GNOME</strong> and <strong>KDE</strong> are not even mature yet, KDE developers
also worries about the future of the wayland, will it last 30 years like <strong>X
window</strong>?</p>

<p>5 years ago, I read a blog about the future of linux desktop, I was using a
window manager called <code>Awesome</code> (one of my friend introduced it to me, I was
enchanted by how he opened two terminals side-by-side, one for coding and one
for compiling). A voice about next generation desktop was just raised in the
linux community , a group of hackers demod the <code>weston</code> project, where you can
rotate the application windows. They also pointed out the existing problems in
the x server architecture(basically it is too old, let us just replace it). It
is cumbersome, too many components, easily dead after package upgrade.</p>

        <p>Rotation, combined with translation and scaling, are the three affin transforms
we do every day in the 3D nutshell universe. The rotation itself, however, is
somehow much more complicated than the other two transform, it is one really
needs a matrix representation among all three. Representations and computation
of it has been developed for years. We have systems like <strong>Axis-angle</strong>
representation, <strong>matrix representation</strong>, <strong>euler angles</strong> and <strong>quaternions</strong>.
Despite I have known them for a long time, when I forgot, the rotation is still
complicated. Here I am writing this again, as easily understanding as possible,
for my future-self (or I can just travel through time to ask myself now).</p>
