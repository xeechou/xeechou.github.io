        <p>Rotation, combined with translation and scaling, are the three affin transforms
we do every day in the 3D nutshell universe. The rotation itself, however, is
somehow much more complicated than the other two transform, it is one really
needs a matrix representation among all three. Representations and computation
of it has been developed for years. We have systems like <strong>Axis-angle</strong>
representation, <strong>matrix representation</strong>, <strong>euler angles</strong> and <strong>quaternions</strong>.
Despite I have known them for a long time, when I forgot, the rotation is still
complicated. Here I am writing this again, as easily understanding as possible,
for my future-self (or I can just travel through time to ask myself now).</p>

        <p>I have been trying to create a animation system for my <a href="https://github.com/xeechou/gltutorial">OpenGL
Project</a> for a long time, one of the
reason is I have limited amount of time after starting the full-time job.
Another problem was that, I mean, if I intend to keep it a clean project rather
than just a school project, building a animation system is like a rabbit hole,
30 lines of code got me another 100 lines of work, it only leaded me deeper and
deeper. Well, it is a perfect opportunity for me to explain the story here. The
amount of skeletal animation that I found online, especially good blogs are less
than a dozen. Gladly, I would like to point it out here, there is a good youtube
video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Cr8Yx3GGA">series</a> you can follow, it
is in Java, the author provided the source code for reference. Khronos has a
shader example <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Skeletal_Animation">here</a>
and there are a few others.</p>

        <p>Template is a confusing and hard features in C++ if you want use it well, and I
think it is also one of the reason which causes c++ programmers cannot
understand each other. Sometimes the Deduction rule for c++ is really confusing,
you don&rsquo;t understand why you code doesn&rsquo;t work or why it works. And Since
<strong>STL</strong> heavily uses nesting Templates, both your compiler and your mind suffers
from that.</p>

        <p>It is 2016, low level coding is not needed anymore. We have programming
languages like <code>javascript</code> and python. When people code everything with a class
and related methods. But do you remember we have a programming language called
C? When we had no class, templates, operator-override or implicit constructor at
esthat time. You actually know what are doing with C, no magic!</p>
<p>I claim no expert to programming, since I only have a four-year-old programming
life. But even you are inexperienced like me, you should still be able to code
some thing in C. IT IS fatigue to code in C, you have no standard containers to
rely on, you spend 10 hours to build a perfect <code>deque</code> data type which works on
amortized O(1) complexity and has no memory leaks before you are able to work on
your project. Awesome!!! But why? Why try to build a huge robust data structure
in a non-OOP language? Instead of trying simulate constructors and destructors,
you could always use a double pointer to do the job. Have you ever seen Linus
Torvalds&rsquo;s double pointer code? It removes on special case where you would make
mistakes.</p>

        <p>I have been studying in programming for 6 years, since my first day of
undergrad life. I haven&rsquo;t realized it has been so long, this studying life
already took away most of my youth. I was a kid without knowing the toughness
of life, to a young man need to worry about jobs and how to start having
family.</p>
<p>The computer industry changed vastly in this period. There was no Cloud
Computing, Machine Learning was only known in Academics. Universities taught
students how to code in VC++. Now everything is different.</p>
