      <section class="post-content"><p>I have been studying in programming for 6 years, since my first day of
undergrad life. I haven&rsquo;t realized it has been so long, this studying life
already took away most of my youth. I was a kid without knowing the toughness
of life, to a young man need to worry about jobs and how to start having
family.</p>
<p>The computer industry changed vastly in this period. There was no Cloud
Computing, Machine Learning was only known in Academics. Universities taught
students how to code in VC++. Now everything is different.</p>
<p>What was my path? Well, 5 years ago, a friend of mine taught me how to install
Linux on a laptop, it all started there. Firstly it was Debian and Ubuntu,
Debian was at version 5 and it did not even support WPA2 encryption.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Why my laptop cannot connect to WI-FI?&quot;,
	&quot;My X.org crashed again after I installed the proprietary graphics
	driver&quot;,
	&quot;I ran that script, I don't know what is going on in the manual, it
	should work, right?&quot;.
	&quot;How to get my speaker to work, I installed Alsa already&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>I switched between Debian and Ubuntu for several times before I followed the
installation guide of Arch Linux :p.</p>
<p>I started to live under a terminal with &lsquo;grep&rsquo;, &lsquo;cd&rsquo;, &lsquo;ls&rsquo;, &lsquo;find&rsquo;, &lsquo;cat&rsquo;,
etc. Then there is the story of how-to-vim. Adapting to hjkl, Esc and i, then
you tried to copy other people&rsquo;s vim script, how to use ctags with vim, how to
use YouCompleteMe. Writing dozen vim code without knowing why. VimScript is a
hell of hack anyway. So my system was basically terminals with editors and a
browser.</p>
<p>Wait, I haven&rsquo;t talked anything about programming yet, should I started at
&ldquo;hello world&rdquo;? No, lets started at CSAPP, you know there is a stack and a heap
in your memory, and modern systems use &ldquo;flat addressing&rdquo;, between these two,
people found there are still some space for shared libraries. Every instruction
that CPU executes follow the same pipeline, and I can actually execute multiple
instructions simultaneously. Do you want your program to hit the cache every
time? Just joking.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t be able to find a job with C, right? Why the hell would any
company would want employees to code in C? 2010s, it is all about javascript,
this has been true for almost 6 years, I still haven&rsquo;t start learn
javascript. But at least, I learned Python. Really, first time I did something
besides computing and digits.</p>
<p>2012, it was just the time of machine learning, python was the first few
languages that developed libraries with it.  Numpy and Scipy, strangely, they
were the first two libs I used just after the night I learned python(You can
learn python in one night, it is true). That was just 2 years ago.</p>
<p>Before I even realized my undergraduate life ended, the graduated offer came to
my hand. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s ahead of me. But anyway, I was young.</p>
<p>With a full head of unknowns, I flew to Canada. No more undergrad type of large
classes, what you have in graduate life is just small classes and
deadlines. Gee, they really passed so fast.</p>
<p>2016, I am in a Computer Vision lab now, just recalled the path I walked, just
realized that my youth almost ends.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">It is 2016, low level coding is not needed anymore. We have programming languages like javascript and python. When people code everything with a class and related methods. But do you remember we have a programming language called C? When we had no class, templates, operator-override or implicit constructor at esthat time. You actually know what are doing with C, no magic!
I claim no expert to programming, since I only have a four-year-old programming life.</p>
