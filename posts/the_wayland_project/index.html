      <section class="post-content"><p>It was a good will.</p>
<p>5 years ago, I read a blog about the future of linux desktop, I was using a
window manager called <code>Awesome</code> (one of my friend introduced it to me, I was
enchanted by how he opened two terminals side-by-side, one for coding and one
for compiling). A voice about next generation desktop was just raised in the
linux community , a group of hackers demod the <code>weston</code> project, where you can
rotate the application windows. They also pointed out the existing problems in
the x server architecture(basically it is too old, let us just replace it). It
is cumbersome, too many components, easily dead after package upgrade.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/x-vs-wayland.png" alt="wayland-vs-xorg"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>X did not die, it lives well even now. It did not stop me from starting a
wayland window manager project though, it was only 3000 lines in the <code>DWM</code> (I
still use it in my laptop) project, how hard can it be? Then I looked into the
wayland protocol and the only wayland client programming
<a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/index.html">tutorial</a> available online(except
those examples from weston itself). It did not seemed that hard, altough I did
not understand very much about how wayland double buffer works, what does the
<code>wl_callback</code>. The client side programming seemed a bit complicated than <strong>SDL</strong>
or <strong>Qt</strong>, but it was doable to write simple applications. But how do we create
a wayland server? Could it be just 3000 lines as well(yeah actually it may be if
I am really smart, it is 6000 lines now)? The first problem I had was
<code>mode-setting</code>, I did waste enormous time writing the <a href="https://github.com/dvdhrm/docs/blob/master/drm-howto/modeset.c">drm
code</a>. It seemed
will take forever. I did not know what it meant for a wayland server and what I
need to code for it.</p>
<p>Spolier alert, It really takes very much for wayland compositor than a X window
manager. Anyway, by the time I was familiared with <code>libdrm</code> code, some one
started trying to write the <strong>wayland compositor library</strong>, (I am not sure the
exact time, maybe there was a gap while I did nothing because of the lacking of
compositor libraries) there was one that you can open a wayland server then have
a small cursor on it, and that was it. Then there was
<a href="https://github.com/michaelforney/swc"><strong>swc</strong></a>, the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5thcLnLHkjs">video</a> looks really nice, very
responsive. It was designed to create simple compositors. It can work as well on
Nvidia GPUs (nvidia only has wayland support from last year I think, they do not
give a shit about libdrm, when they finally supported libdrm, they came with a
different solution). it is now completed deprecated, I think the developer
stopped development even before I knew how to work with it. It was easy to start
a wayland compositor, but afterwards, it did not have any documents about how to
manage the windows.</p>
<p>Then after a few monthes, a appealing project called <strong>wlc</strong> started gaining
attentions on github. I still rememeber the architecture, the first design was
creating a structure and let user writes the callback to inject into it, they
even have default ones if you do not want to implement the specific part. My
first trial on wayland compositor was based on that. Another famous i3 compatible
weston compositor called <strong>sway</strong> emerged from it. It worked but inadiquately,
it seemed to be always laggy and consumed too much resources that I did not know
how, <strong>sway</strong> still has these performance and resources consuming problems.</p>
<p>Yes, I forgot to mention my project name. it is called
<a href="https://github.com/xeechou/taiwins-weston"><strong>taiwins</strong></a>, while I was satisfied
working on the wayland server without the need to start from <code>libdrm</code>. I somehow
made it a <strong>C++</strong> project when I was note competent with it, without <strong>STL</strong>,
because I thought template brings too large binaries and compositor has to be as
light as possible. It was dumb idea, it could save a lot of time if I did not
need to write containers like vector and hash tables. Anyway, without template
and stand libraries, cplusplus are truly horrible, I cannot take bit of
advantages from the power of cplusplus. Maybe just helping me learning
cplusplus. That was the story ends in 2017.</p>
<p>Then when <strong>weston-3</strong> released, the game changed a bit, for the first time,
weston developers realized that it may be a better idea to make <strong>weston</strong> a
library rather than just showing off what wayland can do. <strong>KDE</strong> starts to port
their <strong>KWin</strong> to wayland, Gnome started a long time ago with <strong>mutter</strong> but
finally usable, Fedora 26, I think, was the first linux distribution that came
with wayland support. At the same time, wlc library stoped the development as
well, the author mentioned that he had no time maintaining it so sway moved to
its <strong>wlroot</strong> library. At that time, I switched to use libweston for the
performance and likelihood of maintainance. Again, from the scratch this time,
purely in C. Since I dislike the idea using a crippled cplusplus in a
project.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">Rotation, combined with translation and scaling, are the three affin transforms we do every day in the 3D nutshell universe. The rotation itself, however, is somehow much more complicated than the other two transform, it is one really needs a matrix representation among all three. Representations and computation of it has been developed for years. We have systems like Axis-angle representation, matrix representation, euler angles and quaternions. Despite I have known them for a long time, when I forgot, the rotation is still complicated.</p>

              <p class="post-nav-excerpt">The last post I laid out the story of me with wayland. Technology is fascinating isn&rsquo;t it? Every once a while, there are plenty of new projects that aim to start an revolution, getting people excited. Projects like systemd, Wayland, Vulkan make us think how come we did not think of those before, they seemed perfect at the moment. Technologies always work like a rush of hot wave, our sights are limited at the moment we are in, maybe 5 years from now, even vulkan is not sexy anymore.</p>
