      <description>Template is a confusing and hard features in C++ if you want use it well, and I think it is also one of the reason which causes c++ programmers cannot understand each other. Sometimes the Deduction rule for c++ is really confusing, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand why you code doesn&amp;rsquo;t work or why it works. And Since STL heavily uses nesting Templates, both your compiler and your mind suffers from that.</description>

      <description>It is 2016, low level coding is not needed anymore. We have programming languages like javascript and python. When people code everything with a class and related methods. But do you remember we have a programming language called C? When we had no class, templates, operator-override or implicit constructor at esthat time. You actually know what are doing with C, no magic!
I claim no expert to programming, since I only have a four-year-old programming life.</description>
