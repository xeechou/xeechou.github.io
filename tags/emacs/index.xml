      <description>In my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve somewhat found a way to synchronize my org files. I was pretty happy, I was having just around six org pages, coping them to a webdav server was not a huge hustle :P, util I started to use org-roam. Suddenly I have to create org file for every new zettle, the performance quickly started to tank. This is probably the beauty and curse of using open source solutions &amp;mdash; you have full control of your work and you have to solve problems you created yourself.</description>
