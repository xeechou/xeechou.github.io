      <description>For a long time, I have been maintaining my emacs configuration through a folder of elisp files. I am quite happy about it and even have it working pretty well on Windows (unfortunately it&amp;#39;s my work environment) with help my 3rdparty binaries repository. Finally I decided to move to literate configuration. It&amp;#39;s a thing I wanted to do for a long time. Not because it&amp;#39;s THE COOL things to do.</description>

      <title>Scalable org file synchronization solution</title>

      <description>In my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve somewhat found a way to synchronize my org files. I was pretty happy, I was having just around six org pages, coping them to a webdav server was not a huge hustle :P, util I started to use org-roam. Suddenly I have to create org file for every new zettle, the performance quickly started to tank. This is probably the beauty and curse of using open source solutions &amp;mdash; you have full control of your work and you have to solve problems you created yourself.</description>
