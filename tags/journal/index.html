Recently I open sourced a small C++ library called <a href="https://github.com/xeechou/ebus">eBus</a>(Event Bus), it came along separated from another project I was working on. The idea, or should I say the interface was not very original, I took the inspiration from a much more complicated <a href="https://www.docs.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/programming/messaging/ebus-design/">Event Buses In O3DE</a>. The goal is simple, providing an easy to use <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer">Observer</a> pattern so your can decouple the code from the callers to its callees.</p>

        <p>My blog is now back online, with brand new render engine Hugo. The URLs are
totally different though. Not sure how web crawlers handling it right
now.</p>
<p>After the migration, I did a few extra work for patching the hiccups. Fix the
build warnings and adding new features.</p>
<h3 id="the-about-page">The about page</h3>
<p>In every blog you always have some pages that you do not want it be inside the
blog list. By default Hugo will simply place everything on the &ldquo;navigation
list&rdquo;. Even if I place it outside the blog folder. This is the list your
template is calling <code>.NextPage</code> and <code>.PrevPage</code>. So initially I just give it a
very old date, or simply removed the date, so it will appear as the last on the
list. Obviously I will have to fix that.</p>

        <p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been wanting to Migrate my blog system from
<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. One
reason is that I had enough with python virtual environment breaks every 3
months. Another motivation is obviously I would like to replace Python with Go
in my life.</p>
<p>A long time ago I followed Go tutorial for getting started, surprised by its
syntax tidiness and similarity to Python, and it is way faster. But soon I
found out it would be one of this thing I learned for a weekend and forget all
together, since I don&rsquo;t have any projects I would use it actively. Now after
one month of procrastination, I finally pieces ALMOST everything to reproduce
my old blog. Time for a summary.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been a while that I haven&rsquo;t update the blogs. It is so easy to slack off
on good habits. &ldquo;Oh I will continue once I finish A B C&rdquo;. We are all busy as
hell, in the software world, you WORK, you WORK and you GO TO SLEEP. Like this
one, I am always hoping to switch to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, then I can
continue writing the blog. The thing is, I never got the good weekend to do the

        <p>I am now back in Canada, quarantined again. There is much of internal struggle
whether I should move back or stay in Shanghai? Working for tech company in
Shanghai or many cities in China would be like endless crunching. Maybe I was
not used to this high-paced lifestyle, long working hours. Didn&rsquo;t like
javascript either. It is a pity that I didn&rsquo;t find a nicer job maybe opens to
better opportunities. I was focusing on the development of Taiwins back then,
well it is working now and I don&rsquo;t develop it anymore. The June was pretty
unproductive, ever since the ICL implant surgery I couldn&rsquo;t use computers for
long, even now it is painful to do so. At least I get more time reading books?</p>

        <p>If there is one thing I&rsquo;d like to commit it must be the my time mangement

once I am away. From that reason, I was always on-and-off with using org-mode
due to the portability. We are not in the age doing everything with desktop

        <p>Folks, the Magical year of 2020 is behind us, and it wasn&rsquo;t a happy new chapter
waiting us. Man, I still couldn&rsquo;t believe, once per 100 years, why it was us
who have to face the coronavirus. Now I take a good look of my 2020, I went
from trying to submit a xcbcommon handling patch to weston to writing a full
wayland compositor from scratch. It was not my plan!!! Taiwins should have
being a rather simple application on top of the libweston, the so called
&ldquo;reference compositor &ldquo;, but libweston cannot change keyboard layout once
launching, nor it can support cloning output, there are new bugs when you
digging deep. The worst is that it breaks the library into different shared
modules, and changes lib location every release. It was like it really does not
want to link to it. The codebase was old and long, it was difficult to make a
change and really difficult to get libweston taking a patch. Then there is the
wlroots. If it was released half year earlier Taiwins would probably sit on top
of that. But, screw it. I am doing it myself.</p>

        <p>It is a sunny day, somehow I got up early this morning. The cool, chilling
breath of air reminded me we are at the tail of the summer. It felt so strange,
this summer was like it was never here. Hiking, go swimming, taking a trips and
night outs. all those experiences for a normal summer I would do, they are all
absent, hope I don&rsquo;t regret too much for crunching code at home all these
months. It was a tough year actually, I was determined to push Taiwins to a
usable state, it has been stressful. Every time I look at the pile of the TODO
list, a sentiment of endless development and desperate hit me hard like a heart
attack. I had to work <strong>a lot</strong> to stay healthy.</p>

        <p>Montréal is hotter than ever in this month, under the broiling sun, it was an
exhausting quarantine. The first <a href="/blog/busy-in-quarantine">month</a> I
remeber I was feeling fortunate I got this aleatory chance for advancement of
<em>taiwins</em> in this global pandemic, right now all I felt was the painful
experience converting all the Taiwins server code away from
libweston. Implementating of server side wayland objects was indeed unpleasant
experience. Without libweston, I have to implement every little thing and get it
right, even the basics 2D homogenous matrix operations for coordinates
transformations. Just a days I ago I discovered my mistakenly used rotations in
the &ldquo;Y-up&rdquo; coordinate system (like OpenGL) in the &ldquo;Y-down&rdquo; coordinate sytem
(like Wayland protocol). The good news was that I did not give up, it seemed I
overcame one difficulties after another, now at least I can paint my taiwins
shell objects using a primitive renderer. In the end, hopefully I will end-up
with a working and cleaner compositor library than <em>libweston</em>. This is
certainly an encouraging news as I used to think a compositor library was not
possible to finish with only two hands.</p>
