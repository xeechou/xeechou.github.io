        <p>It is a sunny day, somehow I got up early this morning. The cool, chilling
breath of air reminded me we are at the tail of the summer. It felt so strange,
this summer was like it was never here. Hiking, go swimming, taking a trips and
night outs. all those experiences for a normal summer I would do, they are all
absent, hope I don&rsquo;t regret too much for crunching code at home all these
months. It was a tough year actually, I was determined to push Taiwins to a
usable state, it has been stressful. Every time I look at the pile of the TODO
list, a sentiment of endless development and desperate hit me hard like a heart
attack. I had to work <strong>a lot</strong> to stay healthy.</p>

        <p>July, the hottest month in Montreal every year. The heat wave rushes to you when
you walk outside makes you wondering if you are in some tropical island, it sure
doesn&rsquo;t look like living at 45 latitde northen hemisphere. Last month was a
rapid leap towards wayland objects implementations and now I just hitted the
wall of <code>xdg-shell</code> protocol. Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about what it is like to
implement a wayland protocol.</p>

        <p>Montréal is hotter than ever in this month, under the broiling sun, it was an
exhausting quarantine. The first <a href="/blog/busy-in-quarantine">month</a> I
remeber I was feeling fortunate I got this aleatory chance for advancement of
<em>taiwins</em> in this global pandemic, right now all I felt was the painful
experience converting all the Taiwins server code away from
libweston. Implementating of server side wayland objects was indeed unpleasant
experience. Without libweston, I have to implement every little thing and get it
right, even the basics 2D homogenous matrix operations for coordinates
transformations. Just a days I ago I discovered my mistakenly used rotations in
the &ldquo;Y-up&rdquo; coordinate system (like OpenGL) in the &ldquo;Y-down&rdquo; coordinate sytem
(like Wayland protocol). The good news was that I did not give up, it seemed I
overcame one difficulties after another, now at least I can paint my taiwins
shell objects using a primitive renderer. In the end, hopefully I will end-up
with a working and cleaner compositor library than <em>libweston</em>. This is
certainly an encouraging news as I used to think a compositor library was not
possible to finish with only two hands.</p>

        <p>Forcing a monthly blog update seems to be a good idea, giving myself a reason to
keep paying for this Domain. Also, I don&rsquo;t usually has a topic to address
specifically, a monthly update can fill this role. Anyway, time passes rapidly
in quarantine my friends. I hope a few years forward when I look back at this
moment, I would not feel I wasted so much time. I don&rsquo;t actually feel I made
much progress through this month. I would say, I am digging into my memory right
now, it is hard to recall much in detail. yeah, that is life in quarantine,
&ldquo;stagnation&rdquo;, like the blackwater.</p>

        <p>I update this blog less frequent than once per year, which sometimes makes me
question why do I keep paying for this site. Be able to update blogs is always
my pursuit, unfortunately there were always more code to write. It has been more
than one year, last time I was still on how to MSAA on OpenGL 4, somehow it felt
like a decade ago. The peaceful developing world took an interesting turn. A
long run bull market is killed and NYSE triggered circuit break 4 times in 10
days. People are joking they now have 75% of Warren Buffet&rsquo;s experience. Will
this gonna be the story we told our grand children born after 2020? &ldquo;You know
back in 2020, it was a crazy year&hellip;&rdquo;. We just saw the quarter of it, I am kind
of expecting the crazier in the rest, will it be massive unemployment and a
scary recession will be waiting? This week the market has recovered a bit of its
confidence somehow, despite the Covid-19 cases are surging. A friend used to
tell me, it would be a point where many will be killed by the virus and people
just don&rsquo;t care anymore, looks like the market is at that point.</p>

        <p>The last <a href="%7Bfilename%7D/the_wayland_project.md">post</a> I laid out the story of me
with wayland. Technology is fascinating isn&rsquo;t it? Every once a while, there are
plenty of new projects that aim to start an revolution, getting people
excited. Projects like <strong>systemd</strong>, <strong>Wayland</strong>, <strong>Vulkan</strong> make us think how
come we did not think of those before, they seemed perfect at the
moment. Technologies always work like a rush of hot wave, our sights are limited
at the moment we are in, maybe 5 years from now, even <strong>vulkan</strong> is not sexy
anymore. For ten years, community has been urging everyone to jump on the boat
of wayland. Some major platform adopted it, just there is no money in it. Major
platforms like <strong>GNOME</strong> and <strong>KDE</strong> are not even mature yet, KDE developers
also worries about the future of the wayland, will it last 30 years like <strong>X
window</strong>?</p>

        <p>It was a good will.</p>
<p>5 years ago, I read a blog about the future of linux desktop, I was using a
window manager called <code>Awesome</code> (one of my friend introduced it to me, I was
enchanted by how he opened two terminals side-by-side, one for coding and one
for compiling). A voice about next generation desktop was just raised in the
linux community , a group of hackers demod the <code>weston</code> project, where you can
rotate the application windows. They also pointed out the existing problems in
the x server architecture(basically it is too old, let us just replace it). It
is cumbersome, too many components, easily dead after package upgrade.</p>

        <p>I have been studying in programming for 6 years, since my first day of
undergrad life. I haven&rsquo;t realized it has been so long, this studying life
already took away most of my youth. I was a kid without knowing the toughness
of life, to a young man need to worry about jobs and how to start having
family.</p>
<p>The computer industry changed vastly in this period. There was no Cloud
Computing, Machine Learning was only known in Academics. Universities taught
students how to code in VC++. Now everything is different.</p>
